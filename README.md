## Project Name
Doubly Linked List
## About
This project implements a Doubly Linked List data structure in Go, utilizing generics for type-safe operations. It provides functionality for creating and managing a sequence of nodes, each with references to both the next and previous nodes, enabling bidirectional traversal and manipulation.
## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need Go installed on your system. No additional libraries are required.
## Features
This DoublyLinkedList includes these features:

-Generic-based node and list structures for type flexibility

-Append operation to add nodes to the end of the list

-Pop operation to remove and return the last node's value

-Index operation to retrieve a value at a specified index

-Print function to display the list's contents

## Getting Started & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/DoublyLinkedList.git`
## Usage
Run the Go script (double.go) from the command line: 

`go run double.go`

## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:

-Understand the implementation of a doubly linked list using generics in Go

-Master key operations like appending, popping, indexing, and printing

-Enhance my Go programming skills with type-safe, modular design
